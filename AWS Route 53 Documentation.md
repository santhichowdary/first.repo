1Ô∏è‚É£ Private Hosted Zone
üìå What is it?
A private hosted zone is a DNS zone that is only accessible within a specific Amazon VPC. This is useful for internal applications where you don‚Äôt want the DNS records to be publicly accessible.

üõ† When to use it?
When you need internal DNS resolution for applications inside a VPC.

When you want to keep domain records private (not exposed to the public internet).

üìÑ Example
This creates a private hosted zone for the domain example.internal, only accessible inside the specified VPC.

    "resource_type": "aws_route53",
    "resource_id": "private_zone",
    "zone_name": "example.internal",
    "vpc_id": "vpc-12345678"
}
2Ô∏è‚É£ A Record (Alias to ALB/NLB)
üìå What is it?
An A record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
AWS Route 53 allows alias records, which means an A record can directly point to an AWS resource (like an ALB or NLB) without needing an explicit IP address.

üõ† When to use it?
When you need to point a domain name (e.g., app.example.com) to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).

When you don‚Äôt want to manually update IP addresses (since ALBs and NLBs can change IPs dynamically).

üìÑ Example
This creates an A record pointing to an ALB.

    "zone_id": "Z123456789ABCDEFG",
    "records": [
        {
            "record_name": "app.example.com",
            "record_type": "A",
            "is_alias": true,
            "load_balancer_arn": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-alb/1234567890abcdef"
        }
    ]
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ CNAME Record
üìå What is it?
A CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name instead of an IP address.

üõ† When to use it?
When you want to redirect a subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) to another domain (e.g., example.com).

When you need to point a domain to a third-party service (e.g., CloudFront, S3 Static Website, or an external hosting provider).

üìÑ Example
This creates a CNAME record that makes www.example.com point to example.com.

    "resource_type": "aws_route53",

    "zone_id": "Z123456789ABCDEFG",
    "records": [
        {
            "record_name": "www.example.com",
            "record_type": "CNAME",
            "target_dns_name": "example.com"
        }
    ]
}
4Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Routing
üìå What is it?
Weighted Routing allows you to distribute traffic between multiple endpoints based on assigned weights.

üõ† When to use it?
When you want to gradually shift traffic between two versions of an application.

When you need load distribution across different AWS regions or instances.

When implementing blue-green deployments or A/B testing.

üìÑ Example
This splits traffic 50-50 between two ALBs.

        {
            "record_name": "api.example.com",
            "record_type": "A",

            "load_balancer_dns": "alb-0987654321.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com",

            "weight": 50
        }
    ]
}
5Ô∏è‚É£ Geo-Proximity Routing
üìå What is it?
Geo-Proximity Routing sends users to the closest AWS region based on their location.
It allows bias adjustments, meaning you can increase or decrease the likelihood of sending users to a specific region.

üõ† When to use it?
When running multi-region applications and want users to be directed to the nearest AWS region.

When needing low-latency access for global users.

When controlling traffic to balance the load across regions.

üìÑ Example
This directs traffic to an AWS region closest to the user with a bias of +10.

üåü Summary of Use Cases
Use Case	Description	Example
Private Hosted Zone	Internal DNS resolution inside a VPC	example.internal
A Record (Alias)	Points a domain to an ALB/NLB	app.example.com ‚Üí ALB
CNAME Record	Maps one domain to another	www.example.com ‚Üí example.com
Weighted Routing	Distributes traffic across multiple resources	50% to ALB-1, 50% to ALB-2
Geo-Proximity Routing	Routes users based on their location	Users in US ‚Üí us-west-2
üöÄ Key Takeaways
